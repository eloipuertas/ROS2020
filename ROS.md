# ROS

## Session 1

### Virtual Box Installation guide:

First Download Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS ISO
Then install VirtualBox and add a new Ubuntu 64bits Machine with a m√≠nimum of Virtual HD 20GB space and 8GB RAM Then Start the machine and select the Ubuntu ISO file. Follow all the steps for installing Ubuntu in your Virtual Box. (follow [this](https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/) guide if you are in trouble)

* [Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS Xenial Xerus Desktop image 64 Bit](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* For shared clipboard, go to Devices and select shared Clipboard bidirectional. If it doesn't work, select Insert Guest Additions CD Image in the same menu. **(There's a bug in the 6.1.4 version, use the 6.1.5 from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/download/testcase/VBoxGuestAdditions_6.1.5-136807.iso) instead)**


### ROS Installation guide
Now Run your new Ubuntu Virtual Box machine and install the ROS system following the next guide:

* [ROS Kinetic Kame](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) 
	* Chose Desktop-Full Install distribution.
* [Installing and Configuring ROS Environment](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment)
	* Create a ROS Workspace using catkin. We are gone use Python 2.7 for our robot for compatibility reasons, thus don't follow **Python 3 users** steps.

### Ros Overview

* [ROS Overview](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Introduction)

### Creating your first project
* [Create your first Package](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage)
* [Building your first Package](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/BuildingPackages)



### GAZEBO
* [Install Gazebo 7.x and Integration with ROS using gazebo_ros_pkgs ROS-Kinetic pre-builts  ](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing&cat=connect_ros)
* [Install dependent ROS packages for TurtleBot](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/pc_setup/#install-dependent-ros-1-packages)


## Session 2

### ROBOTS
* [Turtlebot3 burger simulation using gazebo](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/)
* [URDF robot examples](https://wiki.ros.org/urdf/

## Session 3

### Quick Overview of Graph Concepts
* Nodes: A node is an executable that uses ROS to communicate with other nodes.

* Messages: ROS data type used when subscribing or publishing to a topic.

* Topics: Nodes can publish messages to a topic as well as subscribe to a topic to receive messages.

* Master: Name service for ROS (i.e. helps nodes find each other)

* rosout: ROS equivalent of stdout/stderr

* roscore: Master + rosout + parameter server (parameter server will be introduced later)

### Using rosnode
Launch Gazebo with the turtleboot in an empty world. 

```
   $ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
   $ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch
```

Open up a new terminal, and let's use rosnode to see what is running ... Bear in mind to keep the previous terminal open either by opening a new tab or simply minimizing it.
Rosnode displays information about the ROS nodes that are currently running. The rosnode list command lists these active nodes:

```
$ rosnode list
```

The `rosnode info` command returns information about a specific node.

```
$  rosnode info /
```

Let's use another rosnode command, ping, to test that it's up:

```
$ rosnode ping my_turtle
```
